											<h1> Hi! <br />
											I'm Kyla </h1>
											<p>Master of Science, Biostatistics '23</p>
										</header>
										<p>I'm a second-year Biostatistics Master's student at Brown University School of Public Health. While I have a strong foundation in economics from my undergraduate studies at Brown, my true passion is the intersection of data science, mathematics, and public health. I'm an independent, research-oriented graduate student who is experienced in theoretical and applied statistical analyses. My primary research interests are machine learning, optimization algorithms, and experimental design. During my time in the biostatistics program, I aim to explore different areas of research and further develop my ability to translate data into impactful knowledge that serves the ever-evolving global healthcare landscape. </p>

											<h3>Development of Prediction Model for High-risk Sources and Seasons of C. Jejuni Outbreaks Identification</h3>
											<p>As part of a final project, I worked with two other students to create a prediction model using data from the NCBI Pathogen Detection Project, which is a large database containing Campylobacter jejuni isolate samples collected in the United States. Our goal was determine whether or not certain seasons or isolation sources, such as chicken or dairy, are associated with outbreaks of C. jejuni. Our final model had an AUC of 0.896, accuracy of 0.900, and Brier score of 0.073 on the validation set. </p>

											<h3>Differential Privacy: An Introduction</h3>
											<p>As a final project, I worked with one other classmate to develop a website introducing a machine learning concept that we had not learned in class-- differential privacy. Differential privacy is a solutionâ€“ it enables us to publicly share information about a dataset, without actually revealing information about the individuals it consists of. Our website included a short article explaing how differential privacy works and why it's important, as well as tutorials for implementation in R and Python. </p>
